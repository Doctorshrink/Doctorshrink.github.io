## A Note From My Heart to Yours

Before you explore, I need to share my story with you. My name isn’t really Doctor Shrink; it’s a name I gave to the part of me that had to learn how to heal. By profession, I am a data professional, not a psychologist or a therapist.

This project was born from my own darkest hour, a time when everything around me collapsed. In that space of feeling lost and alone, I found two things that lifted my __soul__: __music__ and __love.__ I began to write, pouring my raw feelings into words.

Through this process, and with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT, I started to explore concepts that gave language to my experience. I stumbled upon ideas I never knew existed, like Complex PTSD and the profound Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) methodology. (You can find some of the free ACT resources that helped me at [actmindfully.com.au](https://www.actmindfully.com.au/)).

The music you find here is the result of that journey. It’s my soul’s expression of finding resilience. My only goal is to share my voice and my spirit, hoping it helps you feel that you are not alone in this. This is about connection, not treatment.


## From Data to Dance: My Methodology

While my journey started with emotion, my background as a telecommunications engineer turned data scientist gave me a unique lens through which to process it. I began to approach my pain the way I process data—finding patterns, extracting meaning from chaos, and transforming complex information into understandable stories.

> I discovered I am a **Sonic Data Storyteller**.

This isn't just about writing songs. It's about giving physical, musical form to psychological research and emotional truth. Using AI tools to explore research and motion capture technology to embody it, I'm pioneering a form of healing that combines data analysis with artistic expression.

My methodology for this is what I call **One Signal: Music, Soul, Love.** It's about transmitting healing through sound, movement, and connection.

I'm not a traditional musician; I'm an engineer who discovered that data can dance, research can sing, and healing can be transmitted through sonic experiences. The music here is my soul's expression of resilience and data transformed into sonic stories of loss, grief, and recovery.

My goal is connection, not treatment—giving data a heartbeat and research a dancing body.

You are not alone.
