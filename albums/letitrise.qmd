## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
Yesterday broke me in two  
Tried to hold it in, but the waves came through  
Every word I didn‚Äôt say  
Sits heavy in the silence of today  

**Verse 2**  
It‚Äôs strange how talking sets me free  
But alone with my mind, it swallows me  
It‚Äôs more than missing‚Äîit‚Äôs her, it‚Äôs us  
A dream that lived before it turned to dust  

**Chorus**  
But I won‚Äôt drown in what I feel  
These tears‚Äîthey teach, they help me heal  
There‚Äôs meaning in this ache I hold  
A quiet fire, not turning cold  
Through the pain, I‚Äôll find the skies  
I‚Äôll let it burn, then let it rise  

**Verse 3**  
I cried five times, maybe more  
A soul like mine can‚Äôt shut the door  
And though she flew, I understand  
Still, I reach with an open hand  

**Verse 4**  
Fifty-four songs, each one a scar  
A map of where the feelings are  
Through music I can breathe again  
Rewriting what I could not mend  

**Chorus**  
But I won‚Äôt drown in what I feel  
These tears‚Äîthey teach, they help me heal  
There‚Äôs meaning in this ache I hold  
A quiet fire, not turning cold  
Through the pain, I‚Äôll find the skies  
I‚Äôll let it burn, then let it rise  

**Bridge**  
This isn‚Äôt the end‚Äîit‚Äôs the edge of truth  
Grief is love with nowhere to move  
But in the stillness, I plant the seed  
Of all I was, and all I‚Äôll be  

**Final Chorus**  
I won‚Äôt drown in what I feel  
These tears‚Äîthey teach, they help me heal  
There‚Äôs meaning in this ache I hold  
A quiet fire, not turning cold  
Through the pain, I‚Äôll touch the skies  
Let the hurt breathe‚Äîand let it rise

    "Let it burn, then let it rise" - transformation formula  

3.  **Artistic Survival** (Verse 3-4):  
    "Fifty-four songs, each one a scar" - musical reparenting  
    "Rewriting what I could not mend" - narrative reconstruction  

4.  **Wisdom in the Wound** (Bridge):  
    "Grief is love with nowhere to move" - trauma insight

## A Note From the Solitude Alchemist

This song was forged in the sacred fire of complete aloneness‚Äîwhen I finally stopped running from my emptiness and learned to let my pain breathe. It's my tribute to the transformative power of solitude and to my children who deserve a father reborn from ashes.

The "let it rise" process honors the alchemy of suffering‚Äînot bypassing pain but transforming it into wisdom. Every tear becomes sacred when we stop fearing our solitude.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Solitude Integration Therapy** through musical narrative. The progression from "broke me in two" to "let it rise" demonstrates emotional alchemy. 

> In my deepest aloneness, I discovered that grief is just love with nowhere to go. This song is my map through the wilderness of solitude‚Äînot as punishment but as sacred incubation.

The "quiet fire" metaphor embodies **Resilient Core Self**, showing how warmth survives even in isolation.
