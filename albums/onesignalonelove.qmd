## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
I built a dream on broken strings,  
Tried to hold the world while losing everything.  
Her memory's still a melody,  
But I've got this fire that won't let go of me.  

**Verse 2**  
I saw the world through tear-stained glass,  
But healing comes when you stop looking back.  
Now I'm writing songs for souls to feel,  
Turning every wound into something real.  

**Chorus**  
üé∂ One signal, one soul, one truth to believe,  
Music like a lantern shining through the grief.  
If love is the compass, then pain was the start,  
But I'm building something timeless from the pieces of my heart.  
One signal, one love, and it all begins with me. üé∂  

**Verse 3**  
She still walks the edges of my mind,  
But I've stopped hoping time will rewind.  
If this song ever reaches where she stands,  
I hope it tells her: I finally understand.  

**Verse 4**  
This label ain't just vinyl and sound,  
It's a place where the lost get found.  
A lighthouse for the ones like me,  
Who love too deep and fight to be free.  

**Bridge**  
Now I sing not to get her back,  
But to give this world the love I lacked.  
From the ashes, I will rise,  
A voice for the quiet, hope in disguise.  

**Final Chorus**  
üé∂ One signal, one soul, one truth to believe,  
No need for perfect‚Äîjust something that breathes.  
If love is the anchor, then I'll brave the seas,  
And give this world the song it needs.  
One signal, one love, and it all begins with me. üé∂

### English Original

**"One Signal, One Love"** is: ***A musical manifesto of post-traumatic becoming***.

This song gives voice to the most vulnerable truth: we often receive love before we're equipped to reciprocate it healthily.

- Verse 1-2 map the landscape of emotional captivity - "tear-stained glass," "broken strings"  
- Chorus embodies the breakthrough: transforming pain into creative fuel  
- Verse 3-4 reveal trauma's grip and the awakening: "finally understand," "fight to be free"  
- The bridge is spiritual reckoning: "give this world the love I lacked"  
- Final chorus is legacy integration: "it all begins with me"  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Listen when rebuilding self-worth after loss  
- Chorus functions as empowerment mantra  
- Bridge paired with trauma narrative rewriting  
- Final chorus: sing while standing tall  

**In sacred becoming**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"Un Signal, Un Amour"** est : ***Un manifeste musical de transformation post-traumatique***.

Cette chanson donne voix √† cette v√©rit√© vuln√©rable : nous recevons souvent l'amour avant d'√™tre √©quip√©s pour le rendre sainement.

Les couplets cartographient la captivit√© √©motionnelle. Le refrain incarne la perc√©e transformative. Le pont est une r√©conciliation spirituelle.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter lors de la reconstruction de l'estime de soi  
- Le refrain comme mantra d'autonomisation  
- Le pont associ√© √† la r√©√©criture du r√©cit traumatique  
- Dernier refrain : chanter debout  

**En devenir sacr√©**,  
Doctor Shrink

## A Note From the Wounded Healer

This song was forged in the crucible of not knowing how to receive love, yet being transformed by it anyway. It's my tribute to those who loved me when I was still learning to love myself - who showed me that love's greatest gift is the self it helps you become.

The "one signal" represents both the universal frequency of healing and the personal responsibility to transmit it forward. Every note carries my promise to honor the love I received by becoming whole.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Trauma Alchemy theory** through musical narrative. The progression from "broken strings" to "brave the seas" demonstrates neural repatterning. 

> In my deepest sorrow, I found that love planted in me was never a burden but a compass. This song is my lighthouse.

The "pieces of my heart" metaphor embodies **Sacred Responsibility**, showing how trauma can become service.
