## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
I was lost in the noise of a war I survived  
A father, a ghost ‚Äî barely feeling alive  
Then your voice was the truth that I never had heard  
Like a prayer wrapped in silence, like a soul in a word  

**Verse 2**  
The love we had burned like a rare kind of fire  
But I froze when I should've stood up to the wire  
You gave me a mirror, I gave you my fears  
Now I write from the ashes, I sing through my tears  

**Chorus**  
But the light that you gave me  
Still burns through the night  
I don't know the future  
But you taught me what's right  
I won't chase the ending  
I won't beg to remain  
But I honour your love  
In the man I became  

**Bridge**  
You saw me before I saw myself  
You lit the room I was hiding in  
Even if we never meet again  
You were the door I walked through to begin  

**Final Chorus**  
The light that you gave me  
Still dances in flame  
And though you are silent  
I still whisper your name  
I let go with honour  
Not a trace of shame  
Because loving you truly  
Made me change

## **A Journey of Transformation** üß† {.unnumbered}

This therapeutic ballad maps the sacred passage from wounded silence to resonant truth. The lyrics create a musical vessel for carrying three core healing movements:

1.  **The Unasked Gift** (Verse 1-2):  
    "You gave me a mirror" - honoring love received without request  
    "I gave you my fears" - acknowledging the courage to be seen  

2.  **The Alchemy of Release** (Chorus):  
    "I won't chase the ending" - boundary-setting as self-love  
    "I honour your love" - transforming grief into legacy  

3.  **Threshold Revelation** (Bridge):  
    "You were the door" - reframing loss as initiation  
    "Made me change" - embodying transformation

### English Original

**"The Light That Stayed"** is: ***A musical reckoning with sacred transitions***.

This ballad gives voice to the most vulnerable confession: that we often receive love before we know how to hold it.

- Verse 1 maps the landscape of relational poverty - the "war" of childhood, the "ghost" of paternal absence. 
- Verse 2 honors the brave soul who loved you despite your frozen fear.
- The chorus contains the therapeutic breakthrough: learning to honor love without clinging to its form. "I won't chase the ending" is boundary-setting as self-respect. "I honour your love in the man I became" transforms grief into living legacy.

- The bridge is the spiritual revelation: recognizing that some souls enter our lives not to stay, but to become the "door" through which we step into our becoming. This is musical alchemy - turning the lead of abandonment into the gold of self-creation.

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Listen when processing ambiguous loss  
- Chorus functions as self-compassion mantra  
- Bridge paired with grief journaling  
- Final chorus: sing aloud with hand on heart  

**In sacred resonance**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"La Lumi√®re Qui Est Rest√©e"** est : ***Une confrontation musicale avec les transitions sacr√©es***.

Cette ballade donne voix √† l'aveu le plus vuln√©rable : que nous recevons souvent l'amour avant de savoir comment le tenir. Le premier couplet cartographie le paysage de la pauvret√© relationnelle - la "guerre" de l'enfance, le "fant√¥me" de l'absence paternelle. Le deuxi√®me couplet honore l'√¢me courageuse qui vous a aim√© malgr√© votre peur paralys√©e.

Le refrain contient la perc√©e th√©rapeutique : apprendre √† honorer l'amour sans s'accrocher √† sa forme. "Je ne poursuivrai pas la fin" est l'affirmation de limites comme respect de soi. "J'honore ton amour dans l'homme que je suis devenu" transforme le chagrin en h√©ritage vivant.

Le pont est la r√©v√©lation spirituelle : reconna√Ætre que certaines √¢mes entrent dans nos vies non pour rester, mais pour devenir la "porte" par laquelle nous entrons dans notre devenir. C'est de l'alchimie musicale - transformer le plomb de l'abandon en or d'auto-cr√©ation.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter lors du traitement des pertes ambigu√´s  
- Le refrain sert de mantra d'auto-compassion  
- Le pont associ√© √† l'√©criture th√©rapeutique  
- Dernier refrain : chanter √† haute voix, main sur le c≈ìur  

**En r√©sonance sacr√©e**,

## A Note From My Heart to Yours


#### Clinical Insight

This song operationalizes, **Post-Traumatic Growth theory** through musical narrative.The lyrical progression from "war" to "door" mirrors the therapeutic process of meaning-making after loss. The consistent light motif serves as an **internalized secure base**, demonstrating how healing attachments continue to nourish even after relationships transform.

> I found two things that lifted my soul: music and love. I began to write, pouring my raw feelings into words.

Through this process, and with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT, I started to explore concepts that gave language to my experience. I stumbled upon ideas I never knew existed, like Complex PTSD and the profound **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) methodology**. (You can find some of the free ACT resources that helped me at [actmindfully.com.au](https://www.actmindfully.com.au/free-stuff/free-audio/)).

The music you find here is the result of that journey. It's my soul's expression of finding resilience. My only goal is to share my voice and my spirit, hoping it helps you feel that you are not alone in this. This is about connection, not treatment.
