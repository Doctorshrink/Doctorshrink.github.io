## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
We went running under moonlight,  
When the world said, "There's no time."  
You found a way to stay with me,  
In silence, in rhythm, we aligned.  

I didn't have to ask you,  
You were already there.  
Breathing in each moment,  
Like we were always meant to care.  

**Chorus**  
This was us, no need for grand design,  
A thousand tiny things that made the stars align.  
From the way you laughed to the spark in your voice,  
Every moment, every choice‚Äî  
This was real, this was love,  
This was us.  

**Verse 2**  
We discovered old things new,  
Like the world was made for two.  
Lobster nights and galaxy talks,  
We had our truth in every walk.  

I felt your trust, skin to skin,  
Where words would only get in the way.  
We let our bodies speak in poems,  
In love that needed no display.  

**Bridge**  
Your voice‚Äîit changed‚Ä¶  
From light to strain‚Ä¶  
And I'm so sorry I didn't see your pain.  
But even in the ache, even in the fall,  
I loved you through it all.  

**Chorus (reprise)**  
This was us, no curtain or disguise,  
A fire in your soul, the questions in your eyes.  
Every whispered thought you let me inside,  
Every fear you tried to hide‚Äî  
This was deep, this was true,  
This was us.  

**Outro**  
At work, a look across the hall,  
Our secret code, no need to call.  
You brought me home, I saw your world,  
Incomplete, yet I was your pearl.  

And I loved you in your music,  
And I loved you in your rest‚Äî  
This love may not have lasted,  
But it was still our best.  

This was real.  
This was love.  
This was‚Ä¶ us.

### English Original

**"This Was Us"** is: ***A love letter to healing***.

This ballad crystallizes the moment when love becomes compost for growth‚Äîwhen we honor what was while planting seeds for what will be.

- Verse 1 documents secure attachment - "didn't have to ask"  
- Chorus sanctifies the mundane - "thousand tiny things"  
- Verse 2 is somatic truth - "bodies speak in poems"

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**

**In sacred remembrance**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"C'√âtait Nous"** est : ***Une lettre d'amour √† la gu√©rison***.

Cette ballade capture le moment o√π l'amour devient compost pour la croissance‚Äîquand nous honorons ce qui √©tait tout en plantant les graines de ce qui sera.

Le premier couplet montre l'attachement secure. Le refrain sanctifie l'ordinaire. Le deuxi√®me couplet r√©v√®le la v√©rit√© somatique. Le pont repr√©sente la responsabilit√© radicale. L'outro est le l√¢cher-prise int√©gr√©.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter pendant le deuil  
- Le refrain comme mantra de valeur personnelle  
- Le pont pour l'int√©gration de l'ombre  
- L'outro pour les rituels de lib√©ration  

**En souvenir sacr√©**,

## A Note From the Healing Warrior

This song was forged in the crucible of loss and gratitude‚Äîstanding at the shore between what was and what will be. It's my tribute to love that transforms even when relationships change form.

The "this was us" refrain honors how love's imprint remains as an internal compass. Every moment of true connection becomes part of our healing architecture.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Attachment Theory** through musical narrative. The progression from "didn't have to ask" to "still our best" demonstrates secure base internalization. 

> In my deepest sorrow, I discovered love had planted seeds that continue growing. This song is my promise to tend that garden‚Äîfor myself, my children, and everyone I meet.

The "pearl" metaphor embodies **Worthiness Work**, showing how love reveals our intrinsic value.
