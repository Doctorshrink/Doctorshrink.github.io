## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
I never knew the words to ask,  
Just built my walls and wore the mask.  
Your love arrived like sudden rain,  
On parched earth that feared the pain.  
I trembled at your gentle hand,  
A language I couldn't understand.  

**Chorus**  
But I'm scraping by, day by day,  
Learning how to let love stay.  
In my deepest night you were the shore,  
Now I carry your light forevermore.  
This broken man begins to see‚Äî  
The love you planted still grows in me.  

**Verse 2**  
The childhood wounds I never read,  
The PTSD that quietly bled.  
A doormat shaped by silent fears,  
While warning bells rang in my ears.  
Now in the wreckage, truth takes root,  
No more evasion, no more mute.  

**Bridge**  
Your energy lingers though you're gone,  
A healing light that carries on.  
For my two boys I'll stand up tall,  
Break every chain, tear down each wall.  
This love's not burden‚Äîit's sacred fire,  
The compass pointing ever higher.  

**Outro**  
I scrape... I rise...  
With open hands and clearer eyes.  
The man you saw I'll fight to be,  
Not just surviving‚Äîfinally free.

## **A Warrior's Awakening** üß† {.unnumbered}

This ballad traces the journey from trauma blindness to conscious healing:

1.  **The Unseen Wounds** (Verse 1):  
    "Never knew the words to ask" - alexithymia from childhood neglect  
    "Trembled at your gentle hand" - fear of healthy attachment  

2.  **The Turning Tide** (Chorus):  
    "Scraping by" - acknowledging incremental progress  
    "Love you planted" - internalizing secure attachment  

3.  **Trauma Revelation** (Verse 2):  
    "PTSD that quietly bled" - recognizing silent suffering  
    "Warning bells" - confronting denial patterns  

4.  **Sacred Responsibility** (Bridge/Outro):  
    "For my two boys" - intergenerational healing motivation  
    "Not just surviving" - post-traumatic growth commitment

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}
### English Original

**"Scraping By Day By Day"** is: ***A musical map of trauma integration***.

This ballad gives voice to the pivotal moment when pain becomes purpose‚Äîwhen we stop blaming our past and start building our future.

- Verse 1 exposes attachment blindness - "never knew the words," "trembled at gentle hand"  
- Chorus marks the paradigm shift: from survival to growth  
- Verse 2 is diagnostic reckoning: "PTSD that quietly bled"  
- The bridge is sacred commitment: "for my two boys I'll stand up tall"  
- The outro is warrior's vow: "finally free"  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Play during reparenting exercises  
- Chorus functions as grounding mantra during PTSD triggers  
- Bridge paired with values clarification work  
- Final lines: speak aloud during boundary-setting practice  

**In sacred becoming**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"Survivre Jour Apr√®s Jour"** est : ***Une cartographie musicale de l'int√©gration du trauma***.

Cette ballade donne voix √† ce moment charni√®re o√π la douleur devient but‚Äîquand nous arr√™tons de bl√¢mer notre pass√© pour commencer √† b√¢tir notre avenir.

Le premier couplet expose la c√©cit√© affective. Le refrain marque le changement de paradigme. Le deuxi√®me couplet est la prise de conscience diagnostique. Le pont repr√©sente l'engagement sacr√©. L'outro est le serment du guerrier.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter pendant les exercices de reparentage  
- Le refrain comme mantra d'ancrage  
- Le pont associ√© √† la clarification des valeurs  
- Derni√®res lignes : √† d√©clamer pendant les exercices de limites  

**En devenir sacr√©**,  
Doctor Shrink

## A Note From the Healing Warrior

This song was born in the crucible of complete breakdown‚Äîwhen I finally stopped running from my past and began facing my PTSD. It's my tribute to those who loved me when I couldn't receive love, and to my children who deserve the whole father I'm becoming.

The "scraping by" metaphor honors the daily grind of recovery‚Äînot glamorous, but sacred. Every small victory matters when rebuilding a life.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Post-Traumatic Growth theory** through musical narrative. The progression from "never knew the words" to "finally free" demonstrates trauma integration. 

> In my deepest brokenness, I found the courage to examine childhood wounds. This song is my pledge to break cycles, not just for me but for generations.

The "light" metaphor embodies **Internalized Secure Attachment**, showing how love persists beyond relationships.
