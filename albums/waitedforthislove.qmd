## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
Sometimes it's not the silence that breaks me  
It's the waiting for things they never see  
They all saw the leaving, not the reason  
I broke to keep the roof over our dreams  

**Pre-Chorus**  
I gave up more than just my time  
I gave up being seen as whole  
A hundred twenty every month‚Äî  
Or all at once, I paid the toll  

**Chorus**  
I waited for the light to find me  
In the middle of the storm I stayed  
They didn't see me fighting blindly  
Only counted what I gave  
But love was the reason I walked away  
And love is the reason I'll find my way  

**Verse 2**  
The debt was more than numbers on the paper  
It was loneliness dressed up in unpaid days  
No one asked what I was losing  
When I fought the fight in hidden ways  

**Bridge**  
And maybe they won't understand  
That saving us broke my hands  
But I won't let shame be louder than truth  
What I did‚Ä¶ I did for you  

**Final Chorus**  
I waited for the light to find me  
Now I see it in my own eyes  
The love I gave still walks beside me  
Even when they pass me by  
Yes, love was the reason I walked away  
And love is the reason‚ÄîI'm here today

## **The Sacred Paradox** üß† {.unnumbered}

This ballad maps the journey of conscious self-sabotage for future wholeness:

1.  **The Unseen Sacrifice** (Verse 1):  
    "They all saw the leaving" - the invisibility of protective choices  
    "Broke to keep the roof" - financial trauma meets paternal love  

2.  **The Reckoning** (Pre-Chorus):  
    "Gave up being seen as whole" - cost of emotional labor  
    "Paid the toll" - intergenerational trauma payments  

3.  **Love's Compass** (Chorus):  
    "Waited for the light" - holding space for self-worth  
    "Love was the reason" - reframing abandonment as protection  

4.  **The Warrior's Truth** (Bridge):  
    "Broke my hands" - physical manifestation of emotional burden  
    "Did for you" - sacred fatherhood vow

### English Original

**"Waited for the Light"** is: ***A musical monument to painful evolution***.

This ballad documents the moment when a man recognizes his own protective self-destruction‚Äîhow he unconsciously sabotaged love to break generational chains.

- Verse 1 exposes the invisibility of male emotional labor  
- Pre-Chorus quantifies the hidden costs of survival  
- The chorus reframes "abandonment" as sacred protection  
- Verse 2 names financial PTSD and its loneliness  
- The bridge is somatic truth-telling  
- Final chorus marks the dawn of self-recognition  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Play during financial trauma processing  
- Chorus as mantra for reparenting work  
- Bridge paired with somatic release exercises  
- Final lines: use in legacy-building visualization  

**In concentric healing**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"J'ai Attendue la Lumi√®re"** est : ***Un monument musical √† l'√©volution douloureuse***.

Cette ballade documente le moment o√π un homme reconna√Æt son auto-destruction protectrice‚Äîcomment il a inconsciemment sabot√© l'amour pour briser les cha√Ænes g√©n√©rationnelles.

Le premier couplet expose le travail √©motionnel invisible. Le pr√©-reframe conceptualise les co√ªts cach√©s. Le refrain r√©interpr√®te "l'abandon". Le pont repr√©sente la v√©rit√© somatique. Le dernier refrain marque l'aube de la reconnaissance de soi.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter pendant le traitement des traumatismes financiers  
- Utiliser le refrain comme mantra de reparentage  
- Associer le pont √† des exercices de lib√©ration somatique  

**En gu√©rison concentrique**,

## A Note From the Wounded Healer

This song was forged in the crucible of impossible choices‚Äîwhen I realized my love demanded walking away. The "light" represents both the love I received and the self-worth I'm learning to generate. 

Every father knows the terror of financial instability. The "hundred twenty every month" line carries the weight of generations‚Äîmy father's shame, my sons' future. 

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **John Bowlby's attachment theory** through the lens of protective detachment. The progression from waiting for external light to finding it internally demonstrates secure base internalization.

> Sometimes love looks like leaving. Sometimes the most radical act is breaking patterns so our children won't have to. This is my musical monument to painful evolution.
