## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Intro** *(Whispered)*  
Nobody does this... by myself...  
Stay in the dark... lookin'... callin'...  
Thinkin'... feelin'... *thing*...  

**Verse 1**  
Phenomenal... this connection deep inside  
Somehow I *know*... 'cause I've touched you... touched your soul  
You're so intertwined... yeah, it's... *me*  
(It's me)  
Don't need desire... don't need your care... right now
Just need you *okay*... need you somewhere safe... somehow
But when this storm blows through... yeah, when the battle's won...
All I ever wanted... was to grow... grow out beneath the sun...
*With you*... yeah, just to *see* you...

**Pre-Chorus**  
I know she took you... took you away from me...
Ownership? Maybe... 'cause she *used*... can't you see?
Everybody sees the homewrecker's face... the lie...
But you and I... *we know*... hear you... New... in the quiet...
You *knew*... I *knew*... you *knew*... forgiveness ain't the score...
It ain't that... just *them*... baggage piled high at the door...
Too much weight... you're vulnerable... exposed...
Need the house... need the cash... affairs decompose...
But regardless... *regardless*...

**Chorus**  
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU! (WITH YOU!)
Not 'cause of circumstance! Not 'cause of what we're through!
I WANTED TO BUILD A HOME! (A HOME!)
Make you HAPPY! Make you KNOWN!
Wanted to SEE YOU! Wanted to TRAVEL THE WORLD! (SHOW YOU EVERY SHORE!)
I TRIED! I TRIED! To STOP! These words just POUR!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?! (TELL ME NOW!)
YOU SAID I'M YOUR MAN! (YOUR MAN!)
YOUR CELESTIAL HUSBAND! (FROM ANCIENT LAND!)
I FELT IT TOO! (FELT IT IN MY SOUL!)
SO WHY ARE WE AFRAID?! (LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW?!)
ARMORED IN THIS LOVE! (ARMORED STRONG!)
I TOUCHED YOUR SOUL! WHERE YOU BELONG!

**Verse 2**  
Yeah, the baggage... yeah, the cost... too damn high...
You needed shelter... needed cash... watched the dream die...
But that studio light? It ain't dead... no, ma'am...
Gonna pour that drink... build it stone by stone... I AM...
My own damn sanctuary... microphone my sword...
And one fine day... when the silence breaks... you'll hear the cord...
Invite you guest... my podcast stage... watch the words ignite...
Even if you never come... it burns so damn BRIGHT...

**Bridge**  
*I'm sorry...*
Take the other voice... make it LOUD! (MAKE IT RING!)
A SONG! (A SONG!) Of LONGING! (MAKE IT SCREAM!)
Of DESIRE! (BURNING CLEAN!)
Of FULFILMENT! (LOVE SUPREME!)
Of STRENGTH! (WON'T BE BROKEN!)
IMMUNITY! (LOVE'S TRUE TOKEN!)
WHY ARE WE SO AFRAID?! (OF THE LIGHT?! OF THE GAZE?!)
I FELT YOU! (IN THE ANCIENT DAYS!)
YOUR SOUL IN MINE! (A BLAZING MAZE!)
DON'T LET IT FADE! (DON'T LET IT FADE AWAY!)

**Chorus:**
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU! (FIGHTING THROUGH!)
Not circumstance! Not the pain we knew! (KNEW IT WAS TRUE!)
I WANTED TO BUILD THAT HOME! (FOUNDATION STRONG!)
Make you HAPPY! RIGHT THE WRONG! (WHERE YOU BELONG!)
Wanted to SEE YOU! (EYES WIDE CLEAR!)
TRAVEL THE WORLD! CONQUER FEAR! (HAVE YOU NEAR!)
I TRIED! LORD, I TRIED! (EVERY DAY!)
But these words... THEY RISE! (GOTTA SAY!)
WHAT DO YOU WANT?! (ANSWER ME!)
YOU SAID I'M YOUR MAN! (DESTINY!)
YOUR CELESTIAL HUSBAND! (SET ME FREE!)
I FELT IT TOO! (DEEP IN ME!)
SO WHY ARE WE HIDING?! (JUST LET IT BE!)
ARMORED IN THIS LOVE! (VICTORY!)
I TOUCHED YOUR SOUL! FOR ETERNITY! (TOUCHED YOUR SOUL IN ME!)

**Outro:**
Armored... armored... in this love... (Ooooh yeah...)
Celestial fire... raining from above... (From above...)
Touched your soul... yeah, I touched it deep... (So deep...)
Promised home... promises to keep... (Gonna keep...)
Even if you're somewhere else... (Somewhere safe...)
My studio... my name... my faith... (My faith...)
I felt you... (FELT YOU!)
I knew... (I KNEW!)
Why afraid...? (WHY...?)
Why the shadows...? (TELL ME WHY...?)
Make it loud... (MAKE IT LOUD!)
The song of us... (PROUD!)
Fulfilled... (FULFILLED!)
Strong... (SO STRONG!)
Immune... (TO EVERY WRONG!)
ARMORED! (ARMORED!)
IN! (IN!)
THIS! (THIS!)
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE! 

**Final Fade**: 

 WORLD!  CONQUER  FEAR! ( HAVE  YOU  NEAR!)
I  TRIED!  LORD,  I  TRIED! ( EVERY  DAY!)
But  these  words...  THEY  RISE! ( GOTTA  SAY!)
WHAT  DO  YOU  WANT?! ( ANSWER  ME!)
YOU  SAID  I'M  YOUR  MAN! ( DESTINY!)
YOUR  CELESTIAL  HUSBAND! ( SET  ME  FREE!)
I  FELT  IT  TOO! ( DEEP  IN  ME!)
SO  WHY  ARE  WE  HIDING?! ( JUST  LET  IT  BE!)
ARMORED  IN  THIS  LOVE! ( VICTORY!)
I  TOUCHED  YOUR  SOUL!  FOR  ETERNITY! ( TOUCHED  YOUR  SOUL  IN  ME!)

## A Transmission From The Alchemist

This song erupted from the sacred wound‚Äîthat moment when I realized our connection was older than time. It's my testament to love that survives theft, trauma, and separation because it exists in the eternal realm.

The "armor" metaphor came when I understood: the love wasn't lost, it became my protection. Every "why afraid?" is me confronting my terror of divine love.

**Mystical Insight:**  
This song maps **Trauma Alchemy** through sound. The progression from isolation to eternal connection demonstrates how human love reveals its divine nature.

> In my deepest sorrow, I touched something ancient‚Äîproof that love survives all earthly theft. This song is my armor against forgetting.

The "celestial husband" motif embodies **Sacred Contract Theory**, showing how souls recognize each other across lifetimes.
