**Opening Poem**  
*"Here stands the father‚Äî  
Not the villain, not the wallet,  
But the bedrock.  
Let the system rail,  
Let her rewrite history,  
The children will remember  
Who built the zoo trips,  
Who was the calm in the storm,  
Who loved them enough  
To endure the fire without burning them."*

**Verse 1**  
I stood in the fire, I built with my hands,  
Paid for her dreams while she drowned in the sand.  
Twelve years of waiting, twelve years of lies,  
Now she takes the house, the car, and my skies.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
But the system won‚Äôt see‚Äî  
No, the system won‚Äôt hear‚Äî  
A father‚Äôs love is his sword and his spear.  

**Chorus**  
Oh, I am a warrior of the world,  
A lion unseen, but my roar will be heard.  
They took my home, they took my name,  
But they‚Äôll never take my sons‚Äô love away!  

**Verse 2**  
I woke before dawn, I worked through the pain,  
Put food on the table while she played her games.  
"Just one more course, just one more try,"  
Now she twists the truth, and they call me the lie.  

**Bridge (Spoken Word)**  
*"You think you‚Äôve broken me?  
You think I‚Äôll kneel?  
I am the storm that outlasts the steel.  
I am the father who stands when you steal."*  

**Final Chorus**  
Oh, I am a warrior of the world,  
The battle‚Äôs not done, and the tide has turned!  
Let them drag my name through the mud and the dirt,  
My boys know the man who never left them hurt.  

**Outro (Whispered)**  
*"I. Am. Their. Father.  
And no court, no lie, no war can change that."*

### English Original

**"A Father's Anthem"** is: ***A battle cry for fathers navigating systemic betrayal***.

This hymn gives voice to the most brutal truth: society often fails to recognize a father's love as foundational.

- Opening poem establishes sacred paternal archetype  
- Verses document the betrayal - "twelve years of lies," "played her games"  
- Pre-Chorus embodies the awakening to systemic blindness  
- Chorus is the battle standard - "warrior of the world"  
- Bridge is spiritual reckoning - "storm that outlasts steel"  
- Outro is unshakable truth - "I. Am. Their. Father."  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Listen when facing family court trauma  
- Chorus functions as empowerment mantra during custody battles  
- Bridge paired with masculine resilience work  
- Outro: speak aloud while grounding  

**In sacred fatherhood**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"L'Hymne d'un P√®re"** est : ***Un cri de guerre pour les p√®res confront√©s √† la trahison syst√©mique***.

Cet hymne donne voix √† une v√©rit√© brutale : la soci√©t√© √©choue souvent √† reconna√Ætre l'amour paternel comme fondamental.

- Le po√®me d'ouverture √©tablit l'arch√©type paternel sacr√©  
- Les couplets documentent la trahison - "douze ans de mensonges", "ses jeux"  
- Le pr√©-reflet incarne l'√©veil face √† l'aveuglement syst√©mique  
- Le refrain est l'√©tendard de combat - "guerrier du monde"  
- Le pont repr√©sente le r√®glement spirituel - "temp√™te qui survit √† l'acier"  
- L'outro est la v√©rit√© in√©branlable - "Je. Suis. Leur. P√®re."  

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter lors de traumatismes li√©s aux tribunaux familiaux  
- Utiliser le refrain comme mantra d'autonomisation pendant les batailles de garde  
- Associer le pont √† un travail de r√©silience masculine  
- Outro : prononcer √† haute voix lors de la mise √† la terre  

**Dans la paternit√© sacr√©e**,

## A Note From the Warrior Healer

This hymn was forged in the fires of family court betrayal and paternal love that refused to break. It's my tribute to all fathers who stand when the system tries to erase them - who understand that true fatherhood exists beyond legal recognition.

The Valhalla metaphor isn't about violence, but about the sacred honor of protecting what matters most. Every drumbeat carries the heartbeat of fathers who fight fairly for their children.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Post-Traumatic Growth theory** through Norse warrior psychology. The progression from "took my name" to "warrior of the world" demonstrates neural repatterning of victim identity.

> In my deepest legal losses, I found that fatherhood isn't given by courts - it's claimed through relentless love. This hymn is my shield wall.

The "zoo trips" concrete memory embodies **Narrative Therapy**, weaponizing small truths against rewritten histories.
