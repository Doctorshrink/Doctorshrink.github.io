## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**(Slow, haunting piano)**  
**Verse 1**  
They say "violation" if I whisper through the wire  
Every bridge to you, my son, set ablaze by her fire  
This legal maze is built with traps I can't afford  
One misspoken word... becomes a "court order" ignored  
They warn me coaching's what she'll scream into the void  
Turning hope to proof... that I should be destroyed  

**(Chorus - Swells)**  
So I starve in silence while the lawyers trade their blows  
Counting every second as this poison river flows  
My arms are empty prisons where your laughter used to lie  
This documented patience... is a slow, relentless die  
Oh, this agony is temporary... they swear  
But temporary's endless... when you're not there  

**(Verse 2 - Raw intensity)**  
I dream of stolen seconds on a "friendly" phone  
But your small voice confessing... would leave you all alone  
"Guilty" for the secret... "blamed" for loving me  
While witnesses turn hostile... in her twisted decree  
She watches like a vulture... for the slightest slip  
My love becomes a weapon... in her grip  

**(Chorus - Deeper despair)**  
So I starve in silence while the calendar pages lie  
Screaming "I love you" to the empty sky  
These ink-stained letters scream what I can't say  
Locked in a drawer... for some future day  
Oh, this agony is temporary... they plead  
But temporary shatters... when a heart can't bleed  

**(Bridge - Urgent, building tension)**  
I pace the neutral park bench... every Saturday dawn  
Praying for a shadow... that never comes  
Therapeutic contact? A cold, monitored screen  
While she paints me as chaos... a danger unseen  
My lawyer's silent inbox... a deafening roar  
"IS THIS CONTEMPT IF...?" slams the door...  

**(Breakdown - Whispered, shattered)**  
I document the offer... "Mutual friend called..."  
I document my "No"... as my whole world stalls  
I write the unsent letters... "Be kind to Mom, my light..."  
While drowning in the darkness... of this endless night  

**(Final Chorus - Crushing weight)**  
So I starve in silence... let the court transcripts rise  
Burning every instinct... behind these hollow eyes  
This "clean" and "strong" performance... is costing me my soul  
While she holds the only fragment... that makes me whole  
Oh, this agony is temporary... they claim  
But temporary feels... like a life in flames...  

**(Outro - Fading, broken spoken word over lone piano)**  
"...document your restraint... documented patience... temporary... court notices... reunion date unknown... love you more than... follow the grown-up rules... temporary..."  
*(Final piano note hangs, then cuts to silence)*

## **The Battlefield of Love** üß† {.unnumbered}

This song captures the impossible choices of high-conflict custody:

1.  **The Silence Paradox** (Verse 1):  
    "Whisper through the wire" - communication as violation  
    "Documented patience" - restraint as survival tactic  

2.  **Weaponized Love** (Chorus):  
    "Empty prisons" - arms that can't hold  
    "Temporary endless" - legal system's cruel timeline  

3.  **Double Binds** (Verse 2):  
    "Friendly phone" becomes evidence  
    "Love becomes a weapon" - parental bond turned against itself  

4.  **System Failure** (Bridge):  
    "Therapeutic contact" mocked by monitoring  
    "Neutral park bench" as battleground  

5.  **Soul Accounting** (Outro):  
    "Document your restraint" - the cost of compliance  
    "Love you more than..." - unfinished thoughts to children

## The Sound of Silent Battle

This song documents the invisible wounds of parental alienation - where love must be restrained to prove itself worthy, where every natural instinct becomes legal liability.

The "documented patience" is the cruelest demand - to perform sanity while being systematically destroyed. To starve so the children might one day eat at your table again.

**Clinical Insight:**  
The composition embodies **Complex PTSD from Institutional Betrayal** through musical structure. The tension between melodic longing and rhythmic restraint mirrors the impossible position of alienated parents.

> This is my testimony about love in chains - about choosing permanent scars over momentary relief because the system counts restraint as the only valid currency of care. 

For all parents walking through this fire - your pain is real, your love matters, and this temporary hell is not the end of your story.
