## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
I built a fire but I lit it too late  
You were already halfway through the gate  
And I called your name in the winds of grace  
But silence held your echo in its place  

**Chorus**  
So I carry my love like a lantern in the dark  
I walk through the night with the ache of your spark  
You were love ‚Äî not a lesson, not just a scar  
And if I rise, if I heal  
Will you still feel  
This heart?  

**Verse 2**  
You saw the man I could be, not the one I was  
I spoke in quiet storms, not in the ways you trust  
And when I reached for you, my hands were too late  
But now I build altars from my past mistakes  

**Chorus**  
So I carry my love like a lantern in the dark  
I walk through the night with the ache of your spark  
You were love ‚Äî not a lesson, not just a scar  
And if I grow, if I change  
Will you still feel  
This heart?  

**Bridge**  
There‚Äôs a star on the other side of the wound  
A light that waits in the soul of the moon  
If you never return, still I‚Äôll shine for you  
Not to win you back ‚Äî just to love you true  

**Final Chorus**  
I carry my love like a lantern in the dark  
No map, no promise, just the sound of my heart  
You were love ‚Äî always love, wherever you are  
And if you‚Äôre gone, still I know  
I had something real  
To start  

**Outro**  
You were love... not a lesson... not just a scar.

## **A Journey of Awakening** üß† {.unnumbered}

This ballad maps the sacred passage from emotional captivity to grateful becoming:

1.  **The Unspoken Need** (Verse 1):  
    "I built a fire but lit it too late" - honoring the difficulty of asking  
    "Silence held your echo" - acknowledging the cost of emotional illiteracy  

2.  **The Alchemy of Carrying** (Chorus):  
    "Lantern in the dark" - transforming pain into guidance  
    "Not a lesson, not just a scar" - reframing love's legacy  

3.  **Threshold of Becoming** (Bridge/Outro):  
    "Build altars from past mistakes" - sacred repurposing of pain  
    "I had something real to start" - foundation for new beginnings

### English Original

**"Lantern in the Dark"** is: ***A musical monument to love's redemptive persistence***.

This ballad gives voice to the most vulnerable truth: we often receive love before we know how to hold it. 

- Verse 1 maps the landscape of emotional captivity - "hands were too late," "silence held your echo"  
- Chorus embodies the breakthrough: transforming love from something received to something carried forward  
- Verse 2 reveals trauma's grip: "spoke in quiet storms," "past mistakes"  
- The bridge is spiritual reckoning: "star on the other side of the wound" reframes pain as sacred  
- The outro is legacy integration: "You were love... not just a scar"  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Listen when processing received love after trauma  
- Chorus functions as grounding mantra during grief  
- Bridge paired with trauma narrative rewriting  
- Final chorus: sing while standing tall  

**In sacred becoming**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"Lanterne dans l'Obscurit√©"** est : ***Un monument musical √† la persistance r√©demptrice de l'amour***.

Cette ballade donne voix √† cette v√©rit√© vuln√©rable : nous recevons souvent l'amour avant de savoir comment le tenir. Le premier couplet cartographie le paysage de la captivit√© √©motionnelle. Le refrain incarne la perc√©e : transformer l'amour en quelque chose que l'on porte en avant.

Le deuxi√®me couplet r√©v√®le l'emprise du trauma. Le pont est une r√©conciliation spirituelle. L'outro int√®gre l'h√©ritage.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter lors du traitement de l'amour re√ßu apr√®s un trauma  
- Le refrain comme mantra d'ancrage pendant le deuil  
- Le pont associ√© √† la r√©√©criture du r√©cit traumatique  
- Dernier refrain : chanter debout  

**En devenir sacr√©**,

## A Note From the Wounded Healer

This song was forged in the space between what I couldn't ask for and what love gave anyway. It's my tribute to those who loved me when I didn't know how to be loved - who showed me that love isn't something you earn, but something that transforms you.

The "podium of love" is sacred ground we stand on when we finally understand that even lost love never leaves us. Every note is my promise to keep parsing this gift and give it back through music.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Post-Traumatic Growth theory** through musical narrative. The progression from "hands were too late" to "I carry my love" demonstrates neural repatterning. 

> In my deepest sorrow, I found the strength to continue the battle to freedom. This lantern is my weapon of gratitude.

The "altars from mistakes" metaphor embodies **Sacred Repurposing**, showing how trauma can become sacred ground.
