## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
Just saw the kids upon the platform, waiting an hour in the rain.  
Realities she told to William cut deeper than the pain.  
"Not living here on Wednesday," psychology's decree,  
He's acting out, he's acting weird, asking "Why? When's Daddy?"  
I cried to Geraldine, the traumas listed, raw and true.  
It's time to work on me now, just me, see this journey through.  
Though having them around would soothe, even while I fight,  
To be this new person emerging from the night.  

**Chorus**  
I gave it all, maybe it's not enough.  
This pain is real, the road is getting rough.  
But I'll read bedtime stories, every single night,  
Hold William, Gabriel close, be their guiding light.  
I gave it all, maybe the world won't see,  
But this is everything, this is me.  
Unpacking home, piece by painful piece,  
Hoping the fighting, the hurting, will cease.  

**Verse 2**  
Reading now how narcissistic, destructive words took flight,  
The things I put on paper, weren't worthy, weren't right.  
Not proud, not proud at all, this is the work I face.  
But does she see the changes? Will she grant that grace?  
The pain's the kids, the future dim, a job I need to find,  
A place to stay, a car someday, leave this pay-check grind.  
If I'm out, I'm out, but William's in my soul,  
I cannot lose him, that's the ultimate goal.  

**Chorus**  
I gave it all, maybe it's not enough.  
This pain is real, the road is getting rough.  
But I'll read bedtime stories, every single night,  
Hold William, Gabriel close, be their guiding light.  
I gave it all, maybe the world won't see,  
But this is everything, this is me.  
Unpacking home, piece by painful piece,  
Hoping the fighting, the hurting, will cease.  

**Bridge**  
Baggage piled high from Romania's distant shore,  
Trauma stacked on trauma, couldn't love them more,  
But if they weren't like me, pushed them from my heart.  
Now I see how wrong I was, right from the very start.  
Reading now, the universe is whispering its call,  
Prepared to do the work now, stop running, stand up tall.  
For once, for once, I'm ready, come home and unpack slow,  
All the things inside me, let the healing grow.  
The Orthodox priest looked deep, asked "Tried everything?"  
Cried like never before, felt the solace he could bring.  
Understanding's just the start, the work is yet to do,  
Radical transparency, forgiveness, starting new... maybe with you?  

**Outro**  
August comes, the surgery, be strong for William then.  
A new job, bit more money, build our lives again.  
Sometimes you lose it all, start completely from scratch.  
This big leap in growth now, no looking back, no catch.  
This is me now, uncovering, learning how to feel.  
Hoping that the wounds we carry finally can heal.  
Gave it all... maybe it's not enough...  
But I'm reading bedtime stories... through the darkest stuff...  
Little by little... unpacking home...  
No longer all alone...  
Good night... we talk soon...  
This hopeful tune...  
Is everything.

## **The Journey Home** üö≤ {.unnumbered}

This ballad charts the sacred passage from brokenness to wholeness:
  
1.  **The Platform of Pain** (Verse 1):  
  "Waiting an hour in the rain" - the physical manifestation of emotional absence  
"Traumas listed, raw and true" - beginning of radical self-honesty  

2.  **The Bicycle Revelation** (Chorus):  
  "Piece by painful piece" - the daily commute as metaphor for incremental healing  
"Be their guiding light" - transforming pain into purpose  

3.  **Childhood Baggage Claim** (Verse 2/Bridge):  
  "Baggage piled high from Romania's shore" - intergenerational trauma awareness  
"Prepared to do the work now" - PTSD confrontation  

4.  **Sacred Unpacking** (Outro):  
  "Little by little... unpacking home" - the lifelong process of becoming whole  
"No longer all alone" - discovered strength in vulnerability

### English Original

**"Unpacking Home"** is: ***A musical manifesto of earned security***.

This anthem gives voice to the warrior's truth: we must first become lost to discover our true compass.

- Verse 1 maps the landscape of parental absence - "platform waiting," "acting weird"  
- Chorus embodies the breakthrough: transforming commute into pilgrimage  
- Bridge reveals trauma's roots: "Romania's shore," "pushed them from my heart"  
- The outro is sacred integration: "learning how to feel," "hopeful tune"  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Listen when processing childhood trauma  
- Chorus functions as anchor during triggering separations  
- Bridge paired with inner child visualization  
- Train sounds in production: auditory grounding technique  

**In sacred becoming**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"D√©baller la Maison"** est : ***Un manifeste musical de s√©curit√© gagn√©e***.

Cet hymne donne voix √† cette v√©rit√© du guerrier : nous devons d'abord nous perdre pour d√©couvrir notre vraie boussole.

Le premier couplet cartographie le paysage de l'absence parentale. Le refrain incarne la perc√©e : transformer les trajets quotidiens en p√®lerinage. Le pont r√©v√®le les racines du trauma. L'outro int√®gre le sacr√©.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter lors du traitement des traumatismes de l'enfance  
- Le refrain comme ancre pendant les s√©parations d√©clenchantes  
- Le pont associ√© √† la visualisation de l'enfant int√©rieur  
- Bruits de train : technique d'ancrage auditif  

**En devenir sacr√©**,

## A Note From My Heart to Yours

This song was born in the space between what I couldn't ask for and what love gave anyway. It's my tribute to those who loved me when I didn't know how to be loved - who showed me that love isn't something you deserve, but something that transforms you.

The "podium of love" in the outro isn't a destination - it's the sacred ground we stand on when we finally understand that even lost love never leaves us. Every note is my promise to keep parsing this gift and give it back to the world.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Post-Traumatic Growth theory** through musical narrative. The progression from "silence in my chest" to "I walk with grace" demonstrates neural repatterning. 

> In my deepest sorrow, I found the strength to continue the battle to freedom. This ballad is my weapon of gratitude.

The "compass not chain" metaphor embodies **Attachment Reorganization**, showing how healing relationships continue to guide after separation.
