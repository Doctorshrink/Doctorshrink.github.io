## **Therapeutic Significance** üå± {.unnumbered}

This song reflects:

1. **Letting Go Without Erasing** ‚Äî Honoring love as a gift, not a wound.
2. **Owning the Past** ‚Äî Acknowledging personal responsibility for blind spots and patterns.
3. **Breaking Intergenerational Cycles** ‚Äî Holding space for your children‚Äôs future.
4. **Life as Concentric Rings** ‚Äî Each year adding to the whole, not a linear start-to-end path.

The absence of lyrics leaves space for listeners to insert their own memories and emotional truths.
