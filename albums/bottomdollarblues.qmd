## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**(Verse 1 - Choppy, anxious delivery)**  
*Steel wool skies and static breath  
Fear's a knife in the ribs of rest  
Can't move left, can't move right  
Stuck staring down the tunnel light  
Heart's a jackhammer, lungs are stone  
Panic's got me all alone  
Geraldine's ghost in every door  
Should've ran faster, should've ran more...*  

**(Chorus - Heavier, dissonant chords)**  
*Oh, it's the Bottom Dollar Blues  
Where love's a tool you learn to use  
Feed the machine with tender skin  
The cheapest wage for the deepest sin  
Yeah, it's the Bottom Dollar Grind  
Selling tomorrows, one at a time  
Cashing innocence, penny by pound  
‚ÄòTil there's no more bottom to be found...*  

**(Verse 2 - Slower, dripping with contempt)**  
*She counts their tears like copper coins  
Fills the silence with poisoned noise  
"William‚Äôs fine," the hollow lie  
As daylight starves in a dead-end sky  
No job clock, just hungry palms  
Hiding wreckage in lullaby psalms  
That "fear of lack" ‚Äì a twisted crown  
Dragging everybody down...*  

**(Bridge - Whispered, fractured)**  
*Is this the end? Diana‚Äôs ghost...  
That same cold ache from coast to coast...  
"Not good enough" the serpent sings  
While the cash register chimes on broken things...*  

**(Chorus - Crushing, desperate intensity)**  
*Oh, it's the Bottom Dollar Blues  
Paid in the currency of "used"  
Trading trust for a tank of gas  
Burning futures in a shattered glass  
Yeah, it's the Bottom Dollar Grind  
Rotting the apple, core and rind  
Stealing sunshine hour by hour  
‚ÄòTil the well runs dry, and the weeds devour...*  

**(Outro - Fading, distorted)**  
*No monitor reads this decay...  
Just the price you pay... the price you pay...  
Vitals flatline... in the grey...  
Bottom... dollar... day...*

### Artist's Statement

This song emerges from the crucible of my transformation - from a man who never knew how to ask for help, to a father fighting for wholeness. The "Bottom Dollar Blues" represents:

1. **The Recognition** - Seeing how past traumas made me a doormat  
2. **The Awakening** - Hitting rock bottom and finding strength in love's afterglow  
3. **The Reckoning** - Taking responsibility without self-flagellation  
4. **The Becoming** - Using music to transmute pain into purpose  

> "The love you planted is a gift, not a burden. Now I rise, understanding, growing. For my boys, I will hold the space I never had."

## **Clinical Vision** ü©∫ {.unnumbered}

**"Bottom Dollar Blues"** is: ***The sound of a soul breaking free from trauma's grip***.

1. **Verse 1** - The body keeping score of past betrayals  
2. **Chorus** - How love gets distorted by survival brain  
3. **Verse 2** - Weaponized vulnerability in relationships  
4. **Bridge** - The moment of awakening  
5. **Outro** - Death of the old self  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- For survivors of financial/emotional abuse  
- Validate the reality of trauma responses

**In solidarity,**  
Doctor Shrink

## The Alchemy of Pain

This song is the sound of my metamorphosis - from trapped to free, from unaware to awake. The "Bottom Dollar Blues" represents:

1. **Childhood Wounds** Uncovered  
2. **Love's Revelation** After Drought  
3. **Fatherhood's Clarion Call**  
4. **The Unbreakable Pledge**  

**Clinical Insight:**  
The musical structure embodies **Polyvagal Theory** - moving through fight/flight (verses) to collapse (bridge) to re-engagement (outro). Each dissonant chord represents a neural pathway being rewired.

> "This is my blues - not just of suffering, but of survival. Of discovering that love didn't abandon me; I just didn't recognize its language after years of trauma. Now I speak it fluently to my sons."  

For all fathers doing the hard work - your healing matters more than you know.
