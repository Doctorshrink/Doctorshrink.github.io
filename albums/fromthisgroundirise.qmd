## **Lyrics** ‚úçÔ∏è {.unnumbered}

::: {.h5}
**Verse 1**  
Last night I walked alone, the weight too much to hold  
Dreams without my babies, silence screaming cold  
I laced my shoes with sorrow, but still I faced the sky  
I cried with every step, but I refused to hide  

**Chorus**  
But from this ground I rise, I‚Äôm not broken, I‚Äôm becoming  
There‚Äôs fire in my tears, and a truth that keeps on humming  
I lost and I was lost, but now I see my eyes  
And from this ground, I rise‚Ä¶  
I rise‚Ä¶  

**Verse 2**  
There was poison in that place, I breathed it just to stay  
Gave up all I had, just to not be pushed away  
But love should not be tethered by fear and sacrifice  
I see it now, the chains were hers, but I paid the price  

**Chorus**  
But from this ground I rise, I‚Äôm not broken, I‚Äôm becoming  
There‚Äôs fire in my tears, and a truth that keeps on humming  
I lost and I was lost, but now I see my eyes  
And from this ground, I rise‚Ä¶  
I rise‚Ä¶  

**Verse 3**  
They say to be the savior is noble, brave, and good  
But saving someone drowning only works if you still could  
I gave beyond my limit, played the fool and paid the cost  
But now I draw the boundary, reclaim all that was lost  

**Bridge**  
This is not revenge, it‚Äôs clarity through pain  
A promise to my future: I won‚Äôt go back again  
No longer just a pleaser, no longer in disguise  
This soul‚Äôs been forged in fire, and still, I rise  

**Final Chorus**  
From this ground I rise, I‚Äôm not shattered, I‚Äôm reformed  
Each breath becomes my banner, my truth no longer mourned  
I love, but I protect the light behind these eyes  
And from this ground‚Ä¶  
I rise‚Ä¶ I rise‚Ä¶ I rise.  

**Outro**  
I rise

## **Journey of Transformation** üß† {.unnumbered}

This ballad chronicles the sacred passage from trauma captivity to empowered becoming:

1.  **The Unseen Chains** (Verse 1-2):  
    "Poison in that place" - childhood trauma patterns  
    "Chains were hers but I paid the price" - breaking codependency  

2.  **The Awakening** (Verse 3):  
    "Saving someone drowning only works if you still could" - boundaries revelation  
    "Reclaim all that was lost" - rediscovering self  

3.  **Sacred Rising** (Bridge/Chorus):  
    "Soul's been forged in fire" - PTSD as crucible  
    "I'm not broken, I'm becoming" - post-traumatic growth

### English Original

**"From This Ground I Rise"** is: ***A battle hymn for survivors reclaiming their light***.

This ballad gives voice to the most vulnerable truth: we often receive love before we know how to receive ourselves. 

- Verse 1 maps the landscape of childhood trauma - "silence screaming cold"  
- Verse 2 reveals the PTSD patterns: "breathed poison just to stay"  
- Verse 3 is the boundary epiphany: "saving someone drowning only works if you still could"  
- The bridge is the rebirth covenant: "I won't go back again"  
- The chorus is the anthem of becoming: "I'm not broken, I'm becoming"  

**THERAPEUTIC NOTES:**  
- Listen when rebuilding after trauma bonds  
- Chorus functions as empowerment mantra during triggers  
- Bridge paired with somatic boundary work  
- Final chorus: sing while standing tall  

**In sacred rising**,  
Doctor Shrink

### French Translation

**"De Cette Terre Je M'√©l√®ve"** est : ***Un hymne guerrier pour les survivants qui r√©cup√®rent leur lumi√®re***.

Cette ballade donne voix √† cette v√©rit√© vuln√©rable : nous recevons souvent l'amour avant de savoir nous recevoir nous-m√™mes. Le premier couplet cartographie le paysage du trauma infantile. Le deuxi√®me couplet r√©v√®le les sch√©mas de TSPT. Le troisi√®me couplet est la r√©v√©lation des limites.

Le pont est l'alliance de renaissance. Le refrain est l'hymne du devenir.

**NOTES TH√âRAPEUTIQUES :**  
- √Ä √©couter lors de la reconstruction apr√®s des liens traumatiques  
- Le refrain comme mantra d'autonomisation pendant les d√©clencheurs  
- Le pont associ√© au travail somatique sur les limites  
- Dernier refrain : chanter debout  

**En √©l√©vation sacr√©e**,

## A Note From the Rising Warrior

This song was born in the space between complete brokenness and sacred becoming. It's my tribute to the love that found me when I didn't know how to ask - that showed me love isn't earned but transforms. 

The "podium of love" is where we stand when we finally understand: the love planted in us is a light that guides us home. Every note carries my promise to parse this gift and give it back through music.

**Clinical Insight:**  
This song operationalizes **Complex PTSD recovery** through musical narrative. The progression from "breathed poison" to "I protect the light" demonstrates boundary embodiment. 

> In my deepest sorrow, I found the strength to continue the battle to freedom. This rising is my weapon of gratitude.

The "forged in fire" metaphor embodies **Trauma Alchemy**, showing how wounds become wisdom.
