## A Note From My Heart to Yours

Before you explore this page, I need to share my story with you. My name isn't really Doctor Shrink; it's a name I gave to the part of me that had to learn how to heal. By profession, **I am a data professional, not a psychologist or a therapist.**

This project was born from my own darkest hour, a time when everything around me collapsed. In that space of feeling lost and alone, I found two things that lifted my soul: music and love. I began to write, pouring my raw feelings into words.

Through this process, and with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT, I started to explore concepts that gave language to my experience. I stumbled upon ideas I never knew existed, like Complex PTSD and the profound **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) methodology**. (You can find some of the free ACT resources that helped me at [actmindfully.com.au](https://www.actmindfully.com.au/free-stuff/free-audio/)).

The music you find here is the result of that journey. It's my soul's expression of finding resilience. My only goal is to share my voice and my spirit, hoping it helps you feel that you are not alone in this. This is about connection, not treatment.
